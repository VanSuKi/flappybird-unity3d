# flappybird-unity3d

A finished version of Flappy Bird from The Bird Script Tutorial (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/bird-script)

Please note that not every line of code is the same as it in the videos. I've tried some trials and errors, and not to replicate everything from the videos. Also, I've added a few features, such as a Start Screen, counting down time before start, and randomizing obstacle positions.

Please feel free to use it as a reference, or else.
